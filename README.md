✈️ MAG _Riz – Airport Operations System (All-in-One Stack)

Designed and maintained by Rizwan Kler — demonstrating end-to-end DevOps & Site Reliability Engineering across Node.js, Python, Kafka, Postgres, Spark and ELK.

🧩 Overview

MAG_Riz is a fully containerised simulation of a modern airport operations platform showing:

Real-time flight data & check-in flows

Weather-based delay prediction (Python microservice)

Kafka + Zookeeper for event streaming

PostgreSQL for data persistence

Spark for analytics tasks

ELK (Elasticsearch / Logstash / Kibana) for observability

Terraform IaC and AWS architecture diagrams for cloud deployment

🚀 One-Line Quick Start

Copy → Paste → Run in PowerShell or bash (from the repo root MAG_Riz)

# 1️⃣ Start core infrastructure (Kafka, Zookeeper, Postgres + Spark)
docker compose down && \
docker compose pull && \
docker compose up -d && \
docker compose ps && \

# 2️⃣ Start optional observability stack (ELK)
docker compose -f observability/docker-compose.yml up -d && \
docker compose -f observability/docker-compose.yml ps && \

# 3️⃣ Build and run the backend API container on the shared network
docker build -t magriz-backend ./backend && \
docker run --rm -p 5000:3000 \
  --network mag_riz_default \
  -e KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS=kafka:9093 \
  -e DB_HOST=postgres -e DB_PORT=5432 \
  -e DB_USER=mag -e DB_PASSWORD=magpass -e DB_NAME=magdb \
  --name magriz-backend magriz-backend


That’s it — the full platform (core → observability → backend) will come online in order.

✅ Access Points
Service	URL	Notes
Backend API	http://localhost:5000
	GET /health → status, POST /predict-delay → JSON prediction
Postgres DB	localhost:5432	user mag, pass magpass, db magdb
Kafka Broker	localhost:9092 (host) / kafka:9093 (containers)	with Zookeeper localhost:2181
Spark Master UI	http://localhost:8080
	(if Spark enabled)
Kibana Dashboard	http://localhost:5601
	(after observability stack starts)
💡 Typical Checks
# Check container health
docker compose ps

# Follow service logs
docker compose logs -f kafka
docker compose logs -f postgres
docker compose -f observability/docker-compose.yml logs -f logstash

# Test backend endpoints
curl http://localhost:5000/health
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/predict-delay \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"flight":"MAN001","dep_time":"2025-10-23T19:45:00Z"}'

0# MAG_Riz Airport Medallion Pipeline ✈️

A simulated data lakehouse architecture using **Azure Databricks, PySpark, Delta Lake**, and **Azure Storage**.  
It models passenger journeys between 3 UK airports (MAN, STN, BHX) using the **Bronze → Silver → Gold** medallion pattern.

## Architecture

- **Bronze Layer**: Raw flight data ingested from CSV → Delta
- **Silver Layer**: Filtered to retain only 3-airport journeys
- **Gold Layer**: (Planned) Aggregated insights for analysis

## Technologies Used

- 🔹 Azure Databricks
- 🔹 Delta Lake (Bronze, Silver, Gold)
- 🔹 PySpark & SQL
- 🔹 Azure Data Lake (ADLS Gen2)
- 🔹 GitHub + Markdown Documentation

## Current Status

✅ Bronze and Silver implemented  
🟨 Gold layer working with price metrics + ADF pipeline orchestration planned  
🧪 Testing limited due to Azure quota — pipeline logic verified via notebook mockups

## Notebooks

- `01_Bronze_Layer.py`: Ingests raw trip CSV, writes to Bronze
- `02_Silver_Layer.py`: Filters for valid airport routes, outputs to Silver
- `03_Gold_Layer.py`: Coming soon!

## Demo Users

- **Alice**, **Bob**, **Eve**, **Riz** simulate realistic passenger trips.

## TODO

Replace sample data with realistic airline test datasets

Full ADF pipeline orchestration for each layer

Add Delta Live Tables (DLT) support (optional)

Use Secrets API or Databricks-backed secret scopes

CI/CD with GitHub Actions

Add performance benchmarking (vs Parquet or CSV)

Support for new UK/EU airport expansions

**Update (Oct 2025):** Terraform IaC structure cleaned and validated in `terraform/`. 
Older configs archived in `terraform_old/`. AWS resources will be reintroduced next phase.

terraform_old reintroduced

This repo demonstrates Terraform IaC, NiFi data flows, and AWS architecture design for the MAG_Riz system — created as part of recent interview preparation.

## ✈️ MAG_Riz – Cloud-Native Airport Operations Architecture

**MAG_Riz** is a real-world simulation of a cloud-based airport management system, designed to demonstrate full-stack Site Reliability Engineering and DevOps principles.  
It showcases an **AWS-provisioned infrastructure (Terraform IaC)** with secure networking (private/public subnets, IAM, Security Groups, NACLs), **GDPR-compliant data flows**, and **real-time flight events** via Kafka.  

Key integrations include:
- **Terraform (IaC):** Builds VPC, RDS, ECS, S3, and CloudWatch alarms for DB CPU utilisation.  
- **NiFi & Kafka:** Ingest, transform, and pseudonymise event data before storage or ELK indexing.  
- **ELK Stack:** Centralised observability — logs, metrics, and dashboards for error rate and latency.  
- **SonarQube & CI/CD:** Continuous Integration quality gates for clean, secure code delivery.  

This project was developed as part of my Site Reliability Engineer interview preparation and refined into a reusable architecture reference for **cloud automation, data reliability, and security compliance**.

---



## Quick Start /MAG_Riz ##

docker compose down
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
docker compose ps

# check logs

docker compose logs -f zookeeper
docker compose logs -f kafka

## ELK Stack /MAG_Riz/observability ##

## 🌐 AWS Deployment Plan

This system is built to deploy to AWS using:

| AWS Service         | Role                                              |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **ECS (Fargate)**    | Run backend and Python microservices as containers |
| **RDS (PostgreSQL)** | Managed, scalable database with secure access     |
| **ECR**              | Docker image storage                              |
| **CloudWatch**       | Logging & monitoring                              |
| **Secrets Manager**  | Manage DB creds & API keys securely               |
| **ALB / API Gateway**| External access (GDPR-compliant logging possible) |

---

## 🔐 GDPR & Security Considerations

- ✅ Passenger data is never stored unencrypted in containers
- ✅ RDS with encryption at rest + backups enabled
- ✅ Secrets stored in AWS Secrets Manager (not hardcoded)
- ✅ Logs centralized but anonymized when needed
- ✅ Minimal data retention per GDPR Article 5

---

## 🧪 Sample Test

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/passengers
```

Returns:
```json
{ "message": "Passenger service live" }
```

---

## 📈 Status

✅ Local version working  
✅ Architecture mapped for ECS/RDS  
🔜 Next: Deploy backend to ECS and connect to RDS
